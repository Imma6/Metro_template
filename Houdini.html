                Bitcoin and other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies rely on 
                cryptographic methods to maintain security and fidelity-putting the
                    "crypto" in the name. The "Crypto" in Cryptography The word “crypto” 
                    literally means concealed or secret. "Cryptography" means "secret writing"- the 
                    ability to exchange messages that can only be read by the intended recipient.
                    Depending upon the configuration, cryptographic techniques can ensure pseudo or
                    full anonymity. In cryptocurrency, cryptography is used for multiple purposes-to 
                    secure the

            various transactions occurring on the network, control new currency unit 
            generation, and verify digital asset and token transfers. Cryptography is the mathematical 
            and computational practice of encoding and decoding data. Cryptocurrency generally uses 
            two different cryptographic methods-one dedicated to generating its public-private key pairs 
            and another for the purpose of validating transactions. How Does Cryptography Work in Cryptocurrency? 
            In the simplest terms, cryptography is a mathematical technique that hides information. Several techniques 
            are used to convert data from plain text to cyphered text. To encrypt data, an encryption key is required. 
            This is one of the most fundamental aspects of cryptography. This key is generally an algorithm - or formula -
            that encrypts and decrypts information. These keys make a message, transaction, or data value unreadable to
            an unauthorized reader or recipient. Only someone with the correct key can access the data.

                    <p>A smart contract is a digital agreement signed and stored 
                        on a blockchain network that executes automatically when 
                        the contract's terms and conditions (T&C) are met; the T&C 
                        is written in blockchain-specific programming languages like 
                        Soliditype.

                    <p>
                        Like any other contract, a smart contract is a binding contract 
                        between two parties. It uses code to take advantage of the advantages 
                        of blockchain technology, thereby unlocking greater efficacy, openness, 
                        and confidentiality. The execution of smart contracts is controlled by 
                        relatively easy “if/when…then…” statements are written in code on the 
                        blockchain.

                    <h3>Contract creation</h3>
                    <p>
                        The provisions of the contract are coded in a programming language. During this stage, 
                        verifying the contract's security thoroughly is critical. That is the virtual interview.

                    <h3>Deployment</h3>
                    <p>
                        The finalized smart contract is uploaded to the blockchain in the same way as regular 
                        crypto transactions, with the code inserted into the data field of the exchange. Once the 
                        transaction has been verified, it's deemed active on the blockchain and cannot be reversed 
                        or amended.

                    <h3>Monitoring conditions</h3>
                    <p>
                        These triggers can be just about anything that can be digitally verified, 
                        by mail, like a date attained, a payment made, etc.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Execution</h3>
                    <p>
                        When the trigger parameters are met, the smart contract is activated as per 
                        the “if/when…then…” statement. This may implement only one or multiple actions, 
                        like the Tokenization process.

                    <p>
                        Contract execution results are published. The blockchain system 
                        verifies the actions taken, logs their completion as an exchange, 
                        and stores the concluded agreement on the blockchain. This document 
                        is available at all times.
